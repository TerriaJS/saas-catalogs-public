Time series data collected from approximately 6500 measurement stations across Australia are available.  NEII uses these web services to present the following eight data subcategories:\n<ul><li>Watercourse Level (Water Regulations subcategory 1a)</li><li>Watercourse Discharge (Water Regulations subcategory 1b)</li><li>Storage Level (Water Regulations subcategory 3a)</li><li>Storage Volume (Water Regulations subcategory 3b)</li><li>Electrical Conductivity of surface water @ 25C (Water Regulations subcategory 9a)</li><li>Turbidity of surface water (Water Regulations subcategory 9d)</li><li>pH of surface water (Water Regulations subcategory 9g)</li><li>Temperature of surface water (Water Regulations subcategory 9h)</li></ul>\nThe above data subcategories are also available in the <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/waterdata/\">Water Data Online</a> product.  There may be more stations available on the 'Water Regulations Data (BoM)' network as it updates automatically using web services and includes all stations for which the subcategory of data has been delivered to the Bureau, not just the quality assured ones.  Water Data Online only provides access to data that has undergone the Bureau of Meteorology's data quality assurance processes.",
